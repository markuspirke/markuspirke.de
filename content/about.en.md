I'm currently pursuing a PhD in astroparticle physics at the Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics. My main interests lie in gamma-ray astrophysics, software development (with a fondness for the Julia programming language), and teaching physics.
Alongside my research, I'm training as a system administrator — a hands-on role that keeps things interesting. I'm also passionate about smart home technologies in my spare time.

And when things get a bit too much, I head for the mountains — ideally in Switzerland.
