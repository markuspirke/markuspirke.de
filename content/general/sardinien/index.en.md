## Overview

For this summer vacation, we chose **Sardinia** as our destination. Following the motto *‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt have to fly somewhere, we don‚Äôt‚Äù*, we decided to go by car. This year marked our **first trip to Italy with an electric car** ‚Äì a **VW ID.3** from 2023 with a **59 kWh battery**. We were on the road for a total of **11 days**. We split the journey to and from Sardinia over two days each, leaving us with 7 full days on the island.

For our charging plan, we decided to get an **Ionity Pass** and, whenever possible, use their charging stations. It costs ‚Ç¨11.99 per month, can be **canceled monthly**, and offers charging for **‚Ç¨0.39 per kWh** in Germany and Austria, and **‚Ç¨0.47 per kWh** in Italy.

Here I want to summarize the **climate balance** of our trip in terms of transportation and compare it with a few different scenarios. I‚Äôll also share what we thought were the most beautiful places in the island‚Äôs northeast and talk a bit about how charging our little speedster went.

For those only interested in the climate impact, here‚Äôs the short version:
We drove a total of **2,804 km by car** and **620 km by ferry**, which resulted in **252 kg of CO‚ÇÇ emissions**.

To put that in perspective, here are two comparisons:

* If we had driven the entire route with a combustion engine car ‚Äî for example, my **Golf 7 diesel (2.0 L, 150 HP)** ‚Äî the trip would have caused about **535 kg of CO‚ÇÇ** (158 g CO‚ÇÇ/km at 6.0 L/100 km fuel consumption).
* If we had flown and rented a car on-site, the total would have been about **1,130 kg of CO‚ÇÇ** (1,000 kg for the flight and about 130 kg for local driving).

So, by choosing to go with the **EV and ferry**, we were able to **cut our CO‚ÇÇ footprint in half** compared to the combustion engine + ferry option, and **reduce it to less than a quarter** compared to flying.

### Journey to Livorno

Our trip began on **September 27, 2025**. Wednesday started early: we got up at 4 a.m., mounted our two mountain bikes on the rack at 5 a.m., and hit the road around 5:30 a.m. with our day‚Äôs destination being **Riva del Garda (567 km away)**.

After two necessary charging stops in **Holzkirchen** and **Brenner**, and an additional one in **Trento**, we arrived relaxed at our accommodation in Riva del Garda around 4 p.m. In the evening, we went for a short bike ride and enjoyed a delicious dinner at our **favorite pizzeria, Bella Napoli**.
After a good night‚Äôs sleep and a hearty breakfast, we continued toward **Livorno**, with a stop in **Milan**. For the 480 km stretch, we made three charging stops, as we wanted to board the ferry with a comfortable reserve.

Our first stop was in **Affi**, where there are about 20 Ionity chargers ‚Äî though finding them proved harder than expected, and we had to drive a short stretch the wrong way down a one-way street üòÖ. It was busy, so charging speed was throttled.
In **Milan**, we charged again ‚Äî at a steep **‚Ç¨0.90 per kWh**, but in a perfect location, saving us parking fees.
We made our last charging stop shortly before reaching **Livorno**.

After that, we had another tasty pizza near the harbor and then navigated the very winding and poorly signposted port area.

In total, we drove **1,047 km** on the outbound journey.
Average consumption: **20.5 kWh/100 km**, including charging losses.
We spent **3 h 05 min charging**, but we never had to just wait ‚Äî we always used the time to eat or explore.
Total charging cost: **‚Ç¨106**.
Emissions: **~60 kg CO‚ÇÇ**.

| Charging Stop | Time (min) | Energy (kWh) | Cost (‚Ç¨) | CO‚ÇÇ Emissions (kg) |
| ------------- | :--------: | :----------: | :------: | :----------------: |
| Holzkirchen   |     45     |      47      |    18    |         17         |
| Brenner       |     27     |      26      |    12    |          8         |
| Trento        |     14     |      14      |     7    |          4         |
| Affi          |     17     |      16      |     7    |          5         |
| Milan[^1]     |     53     |      48      |    44    |         15         |
| Livorno       |     29     |      39      |    18    |         12         |
| **Total**     |   **185**  |    **190**   |  **106** |       **61**       |

### Ferry to Olbia

For the ferry to **Olbia**, we paid **‚Ç¨280** for two people, one car, and an inside cabin (no window).

To estimate CO‚ÇÇ emissions, typical values are around **18‚Äì19 g CO‚ÇÇ/km** per person without a car and **130 g CO‚ÇÇ/km** with a car.
Our ferry company, **Moby Lines**, advertises that their new ships have a smaller footprint thanks to partial use of LNG gas. However, the share and overall impact of LNG (production, liquefaction, and transport) are difficult to calculate.
So, we‚Äôll stick with the average figures above.

For a **310 km** trip with two people and one car, that amounts to about **46 kg CO‚ÇÇ**.

## Getting Around on the Island

On Sardinia, we drove a total of **827 km**.
The ID.3 performed beautifully ‚Äî consumption closely matched **WLTP** values, and we achieved a range of nearly **400 km**.

We charged exclusively while doing our supermarket shopping ‚Äî though not at Ionity stations as before. In **Olbia**, we could have charged at **Lidl**, but we preferred the **Conad Superstore** north of Olbia, which was closer to our accommodation. Charging there was slightly more expensive.

According to **Electricity Maps**, the average CO‚ÇÇ intensity on Sardinia that week was **477 g/kWh** ‚Äî quite high for a place with so much wind and sun potential.
In reality, however, only **20%** of the power came from solar, **29%** from coal, and **33%** from gas.

That means the **129 kWh** we used (**15.6 kWh/100 km**) resulted in about **62 kg CO‚ÇÇ**.

Most days we spent doing something active in the morning and relaxing on the beach in the afternoon.
Our highlights included:

* **Cycling tour around the islands of La Maddalena and Caprera**
* **Canyoning with Kikoo in the Rio Pitrisconi**
* **Hiking to the viewpoint above Cala Goloritz√©**
* **Climbing Monte Cannone on Tavolara**

### Ferry Back to Livorno

For the return ferry, we can use the same value again ‚Äî another **46 kg CO‚ÇÇ**.
In **Olbia**, boarding the ferry was well organized, and finding the right ship was easy.
The crossing was uneventful ‚Äî just as you‚Äôd want ‚Äî and we slept well, disembarking punctually in the morning to head toward **Pisa**.

---

### Return Journey

We spent the morning of our second-to-last day in **Pisa**, where we could charge centrally again, saving parking fees.
Unfortunately, all the charging station displays were broken, so charging had to be started via **QR code**.
After taking some creative photos at the **Leaning Tower**, we continued after about three hours toward **Merano**.

There we stayed at a familiar place ‚Äî the **Gurterhof in Sankt Georgen**.
Highlights of the Gurterhof include the **pool**, **breakfast terrace overlooking the Mutspitze**, and the **warm, welcoming family** who run it. We could charge the car overnight directly at the accommodation.

The next morning started with an amazing breakfast. Afterwards, we went for a **mountain hike** to the summit of Hirzer via H√∂nigsspitze.
The return home took us over the **mountain pass**, and after two more charging stops, we arrived back home safely after a wonderful **11-day trip**.

| Charging Stop  | Time (min) | Energy (kWh) | Cost (‚Ç¨) | CO‚ÇÇ Emissions (kg) |
| :------------- | :--------: | :----------: | :------: | :----------------: |
| Pisa           |      ‚Äì     |      30      |    21    |         6.9        |
| Bologna        |     18     |      21      |    10    |         4.6        |
| Affi           |     36     |      44      |    21    |         9.8        |
| Merano[^1][^2] |      ‚Äì     |      33      |    13    |         7.3        |
| W√∂rgl          |     28     |      30      |    12    |         2.5        |
| Pfaffenhofen   |     28     |      35      |    13    |         6.4        |
| **Total**      |   **122**  |    **193**   |  **79**  |      **37.5**      |
